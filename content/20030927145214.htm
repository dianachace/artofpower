<h1>Abstract</h1>
The Proposal:&nbsp; The Art of Power, a grand-scale exhibition of 20th
century industrial models of power technologies, proposes to gather
together and bring alive a series of dormant, standalone pieces,
currently languishing in corporate storage facilities, and display them
without their protective sheaths or skins in an historical exhibit of
the model-maker's art. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
The core of the show will focus on models of large industrial sites
built during the 1970's and 80's. These huge, awe-inspiring artifacts,
some of which are still used today, represent a significant and
unexamined period in the history of industrial design.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;<br>
The Context:&nbsp; The Art of Power represents the latest stage in a
150 year-old discussion about how to bring people face to face with the
technologies that empower and enable their lives.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;<br>
The Art of Power will rival New York's MOMA's Machine Art show of 1934
, which forever altered the public's perception of fine art by
exhibiting familiar industrial objects, including a plane propeller and
a ball bearing—as art.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;<br>
These historic models will reveal to an art-viewing public the
mysteries of the design process while exposing them to the striking
beauty of the infrastructures of technologies they might not experience
otherwise. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
The Aesthetics: The models are marvels of verisimilitude, as novel and
engaging in the 21st century as trompe l'oeil painting was in the
19th.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;<br>
The pieces will be chosen for their formal beauty and for the dramatic
sense impressions they inspire, especially in relation to scale and
balance.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;<br>
In the body of the exhibit viewers might pass between segments of
turbine and auxiliary units towering above their heads. These
large-scale ‘miniatures' will evoke the monumentality of the sites they
represent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;In addition, these colorful, plexi-glass ‘jungles' will
demonstrate the visual density and technological complexity that
distinguishes these astonishing industrial models in the age of
particle physics.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;<br>
Social Goal: Insofar as CAD technology has superceded model-building as
the primary design tool, these industrial models reinforce the value of
hand-crafted labor that is fast disappearing in our increasingly
computer-generated world.<br>

<h1>Biography </h1> Diana Chace, art collector and industrial model builder, holds an
interdisciplinary degree from Vassar College in Art History,
Anthropology, and Theatre Set Design. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
After college, Ms. Chace apprenticed at Architectural Models, Inc. in
San Francisco, building plexi-glass presentation models, including
studies for solar-paneled homes. She then worked in-house at HOK
Architects and at Bullfield, Volkmann, Stockwell, making board and
paper models of office buildings. At Bechtel Power she expanded her
practice to include industrial design, where she refined her craft by
constructing models of nuclear power and fossil fuel plants. She then
worked for Chevron and Kaiser, continuing to build check-design models
of large industrial sites, including a Mining and Metallurgical and an
Orthene plant. Chace capped her fifteen-year model-building career by
constructing one of the first architectural miniatures of George
Lucas's Skywalker ranch. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
During the late 1980's Chace turned her attention to art. Working
closely with the Asian Art Museum, she became a formidable collector of
Southeast Asian and Indonesian art and artifacts. On her frequent trips
to Asia she also took photographs of pagodas, palaces, ritual tools,
and people at work. These ethnographic studies became the basis of a
film she made in 1990 that provides viewers of her collection with a
moving cultural record of the sources of her interest in eastern art.
Chace frequently gives public tours of her artworks, as well as
informal talks. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
Her dual career as an industrial model builder and Asian art collector
has inspired Ms. Chace to produce a large-scale museum exhibition of
industrial models of power technologies. Her hands-on experience with
these models has given her a unique understanding for a significant
period in the history of industrial design. <br>
