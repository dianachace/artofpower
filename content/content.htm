<h1>Abstract</h1><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Proposal</span>: Models of Power
is an art exhibition of 3D industrial models of power technologies. The
show will include sections of gigantic, colorful plexiglas engineering
models of power plants (primarily nuclear and fossil fuel) as well as
photographs of the models. The exhibit will celebrate an undocumented
period in the history of industrial design.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Context</span>: New York MOMA's
Machine Art show of 1934 forever altered the public's perception of
Fine Art by exhibiting familiar industrial objects, including a plane
propeller and a ball bearing-as art. It also created a modernist
machine aesthetic of singular objects with smooth, sleek bodies that
continue to influence product design today.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Aesthetic</span>: Models of Power
will introduce a new machine aesthetic of incredible visual density,
expressed as a complex layering and interweaving of colorful tubular
forms. The exhibit will enhance the wonder and excitement generated by
these awe-inspiring infrastructures of technologies the viewing public
might never have the opportunity to see otherwise. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Social Goal</span>: Insofar as CAD
technology has superceded model-building as the primary design tool,
these industrial models reinforce the value of hand-crafted labor that
is fast disappearing in our increasingly computer-generated world.
These large-scale 'miniatures' will evoke the monumentality of the
sites they represent.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Advantages to Utility Companies</span>: The models are beautiful and touchable. <br>
Experiencing their visual power and the precision required to build
them will put a human face on the nuclear industry for the viewing
public for whom art is a natural bridge to the wonders of technology. <br>

<p><a href="http://www.dianachace.com">
 Diana Chace</a>, art collector and industrial model builder, holds an
interdisciplinary degree from Vassar College in Art History,
Anthropology, and Theatre Set Design. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
After college, Ms. Chace apprenticed at Architectural Models, Inc. in
San Francisco, building plexi-glass presentation models, including
studies for solar-paneled homes. She then worked in-house at HOK
Architects and at Bullfield, Volkmann, Stockwell, making board and
paper models of office buildings. At Bechtel Power she expanded her
practice to include industrial design, where she refined her craft by
constructing models of nuclear power and fossil fuel plants. She then
worked for Chevron and Kaiser, continuing to build check-design models
of large industrial sites, including a Mining and Metallurgical and an
Orthene plant. Chace capped her fifteen-year model-building career by
constructing one of the first architectural miniatures of George
Lucas's Skywalker ranch. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
During the late 1980's Chace turned her attention to art. Working
closely with the Asian Art Museum, she became a formidable collector of
Southeast Asian and Indonesian art and artifacts. On her frequent trips
to Asia she also took photographs of pagodas, palaces, ritual tools,
and people at work. These ethnographic studies became the basis of a
film she made in 1990 that provides viewers of her collection with a
moving cultural record of the sources of her interest in eastern art.
Chace frequently gives public tours of her artworks, as well as
informal talks. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Her dual career as an industrial model builder and Asian art collector
has inspired Ms. Chace to produce a large-scale museum exhibition of
industrial models of power technologies. Her hands-on experience with
these models has given her a unique understanding for a significant
period in the history of industrial design.</p>
